        <div class='content-section'>
            <h2>What are your requirements for joining?</h2>
            <p>You must be willing to use Teamspeak 3 with Task Force Beta, are over the age of 16, and are at least able to attend most operations (though we do understand people are busy and allow people to submit LOAs before missions).</p>
        </div>

        <div class='content-section'>
            <h2>How many people come each week?</h2>
            <p>We have an average attendance of 50+ people per operation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class='content-section'>
            <h2>When do you have operations?</h2>
            <p>Most of our members are based out of North America, and as such our operations and training stay in the area of 5-10pm EST with our main operations starting at 7pm EST every Saturday.</p>
        </div>

        <div class='content-section'>
            <h2>How long do operations typically last?</h2>
            <p>We shoot for 2+ hours as it's enough time to brief, deploy, execute, and exfil from a multi-objective mission without making the mission seem drawn out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class='content-section'>
            <h2>Do you have automatic, or user-made missions?</h2>
            <p>We have both! Our operations are always hand-made by Zeus and follow a storyline put in place by our Creative Team 
            that transpires over several weeks which we call "Campaigns". However, when there are no training or operations, we do host an OPTRE-based Liberation on our main server for people to enjoy.</p>
